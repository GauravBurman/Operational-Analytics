Call Center optimization problem using Linear Programming

Problem Statement
Assume, you are setting up a call center for a mid-sized E-Commerce firm. You have been asked to find the total strength of callers required for this requirement. This requirement will be outsourced to a call center which guarantees availability of caller for 24 hours with the exact same efficiency.

Using this efficiency, you have also estimated the time of each call from the customer and the duration of these calls. This estimation is based on your market research and prediction through customer behavior in past. You can assume that this prediction is accurate. Now, you need to estimate the following:

 1. What is the minimum number of callers required if you need to ensure that no customer waits to reach out to the representative (Zero waiting time)?
 2. What is the minimum number of callers required if you need to ensure that no customer waits for more than 30 minutes (Max. 30 minutes waiting time)?
